# Sudoku_solver
Sudoku solvers for 9x9, 16x16 and 25x25 grids

Solves sudoku puzzles by using a rule-based solver algorithm with a default of a DFS algorithm once the rules may longer be
applied given a certain puzzle. 

It still needs a lot more rules as seen here: https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm 
Feel free to implement them :D
